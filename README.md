# My Portfolio

## About

This portfolio website is built using a forked branch of [RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio)
project on github. It has been adapted with my information and skills, along with
some structural and visual changes.

The project has been Docker-ized and can be hosted within an nginx shell.
